Goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve fight reliability thereby improving customer relaibility.\n\nBelow are the key report items,\n\n*   Yearly airline performance report\u00a0\n*   Yearly average flight delay statistics\n\n*NOTE:* Year range is between 2005 and 2020.\n\n## Components of the report items\n\n1.  Yearly airline performance report\n\n    For the chosen year provide,\n\n    *   Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.\n    *   Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.\n    *   Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.\n    *   Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.\n    *   Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.\n2.  Yearly average flight delay statistics\n\n    For the chosen year provide,\n\n    *   Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.\n    *   Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.\n    *   Monthly average natioanl air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.\n    *   Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.\n    *   Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.\n\n    *NOTE:* You have worked created the same dashboard components in `Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard` section. We will be reusing the same.\n\n## Expected Layout\n\n<center>\n    <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/images/Layout.png\" width=\"2000\" alt=\"cognitiveclass.ai logo\"/>\n</center>\n"

We will do this by 3 changes:\n\n    1.  Add `app.config.suppress_callback_exceptions = True` right after `app = JupyterDash(__name__)`.\n\n    2.  Having empty html.Div and use the callback to Output the dcc.graph as the Children of that Div.\n\n    3.  Add a state variable in addition to callback decorator input and output parameter. This will allow us to pass extra values without firing the callbacks.\n        Here, we need to pass two inputs `chart type` and `year`. Input is read only after user entering all the information.\n\n*   Use new html display style `flex` to arrange the dropdown menu with description.\n\n*   Update app run step to avoid getting error message before initiating callback.\n\n*NOTE:* These steps are only for review.\n"
